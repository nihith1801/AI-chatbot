# AI-chatbot
An AI chatbot which imports the responses from Chatgpt and uses ElevenLabs API for text to speech translation. Currently under development.
Users are given option whether to use text based format or use Voice based input to talk with the chatbot.


Needed dependencies:

OpenAI
ElevenLabs
GamePy
Playsound
Speechrecognition
Ffmpeg

You can import these using 'pip' command in the cmd. 
(If pip is not working, please update the pip path to the environment variables)

Default is a short tempered girl. One can change the personality later. Will include the choice during run time in future updates.

You will also need an OpenAi key in order to access the chatbot.
